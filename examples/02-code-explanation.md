# Code Explanation Examples

This section provides practical examples of effective prompts for requesting code explanations from Amazon Q Developer. Each example demonstrates key prompt engineering techniques and best practices for getting clear, comprehensive explanations.

## Basic Code Explanation

### Example 1: Simple Function Explanation

**Prompt:**
```
Explain this code:

function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};
  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) {
      return cache[key];
    }
    const result = fn.apply(this, args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  };
}
```

**Improved Prompt:**
```
Explain this JavaScript memoization function:

```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};
  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) {
      return cache[key];
    }
    const result = fn.apply(this, args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  };
}
```

Please provide:
1. A high-level explanation of what memoization is and why it's useful
2. A line-by-line breakdown of how this implementation works
3. An explanation of the key techniques used (closures, JSON.stringify, apply)
4. Potential edge cases or limitations of this implementation
5. A simple example showing how this function would be used and the performance benefit

I'm a mid-level JavaScript developer, so please include relevant technical details but avoid overly basic explanations.
```

**Why It's Better:**

  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }
  
  const pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];
  const left = arr.filter(x => x < pivot);
  const middle = arr.filter(x => x === pivot);
  const right = arr.filter(x => x > pivot);
  
  return [...quickSort(left), ...middle, ...quickSort(right)];
}
```

**Improved Prompt:**
```

```javascript
function quickSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }
  
  const pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];
  const left = arr.filter(x => x < pivot);
